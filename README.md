## Description
To build onto the functionality of the typescript vehicle builder application that was my starting point, I integrated new classes for Truck and Motorbike with moethods of tow and wheelie that only work with those individual classes. In my proccess of doing this I learned more about using typescript and of course as can be implied by that: javascript.
